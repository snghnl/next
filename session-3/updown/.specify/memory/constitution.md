# UpDown Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence
Code MUST be clean, readable, and maintainable. Every function, class, and module MUST have a single, clear responsibility. Complex logic MUST be broken down into smaller, testable units. Comments MUST explain why, not what. Code MUST follow consistent formatting and naming conventions across the entire codebase.

**Rationale**: High-quality code reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and enables faster development cycles while reducing technical debt.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All features MUST follow Test-Driven Development (TDD). Tests MUST be written before implementation. Every unit, integration, and contract test MUST pass before code is merged. Test coverage MUST meet minimum thresholds defined per project. Tests MUST be maintainable and provide clear failure messages.

**Rationale**: TDD ensures requirements are well-understood, prevents regression bugs, and provides living documentation of system behavior.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces MUST follow consistent design patterns and interaction models. Components MUST be reusable and follow established design systems. User flows MUST be intuitive and accessible. Performance MUST meet user expectations with sub-200ms response times for interactive elements.

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces user confusion, improves adoption, and creates a professional product experience.

### IV. Clean Architecture
System architecture MUST separate concerns into distinct layers. Business logic MUST be independent of frameworks, databases, and external services. Dependencies MUST flow inward toward the business domain. Each layer MUST have clearly defined interfaces and contracts.

**Rationale**: Clean architecture enables testability, maintainability, and flexibility to change external dependencies without affecting core business logic.

### V. Component Modularity
All components and modules MUST be self-contained with clear interfaces. Each module MUST have a single responsibility and minimal coupling to other modules. Public APIs MUST be stable and versioned. Internal implementation details MUST be hidden from consumers.

**Rationale**: Modular design enables parallel development, reusability, easier testing, and system evolution without widespread changes.

## Performance Standards

All code MUST meet defined performance requirements. Critical paths MUST be optimized for speed and memory efficiency. Database queries MUST be optimized and avoid N+1 problems. Bundle sizes MUST be minimized for web applications. Memory usage MUST be monitored and managed to prevent leaks.

**Performance Targets**:
- API responses: <200ms p95 latency
- UI interactions: <100ms response time
- Build times: <2 minutes for full builds
- Test suite: <30 seconds for unit tests

## Quality Gates

All code changes MUST pass through automated quality gates including linting, type checking, security scanning, and performance benchmarks. Manual code reviews MUST verify adherence to architectural principles and coding standards. All tests MUST pass before merging. Documentation MUST be updated for any public API changes.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Any deviation from these principles MUST be explicitly justified in writing and approved by the team lead. Complexity that violates these principles MUST be refactored unless a compelling business case exists.

**Amendment Process**: Constitutional changes require team consensus and must include migration plans for existing code that may be affected. All template files must be updated to reflect constitutional changes.

**Compliance Review**: Monthly reviews will assess adherence to constitutional principles and identify areas for improvement.
